# Neural Networks MNIST

This project implements a simple neural network to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd Neural-networks-minist-scratch
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download the MNIST dataset and place it in the project directory.

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter notebook:

   ```sh
   jupyter notebook "Neural networks.ipynb"
   ```

2. Run the cells in the notebook to load the data, train the neural network, and evaluate its performance.
